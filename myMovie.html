    <h1>Dakotah Haughey</h1>
    <p>My favorite movie would probably have to be Zombieland. It is a very classic zombie apocolypse movie, but has a good plot and is funny as well. It has a few good twists, and while it is thrilling, I consider it a comfort movie. I also like the actors in it and they play their roles very well.</p>
