        <h3>Day-old Pizza</h3>
        <p>I have lots of foods that I love, and my favorite food changes <b>excedingly</b> often, but one that is always a good option is day-old pizza. I find cold pizza the day after to be such a good comfort food. It's easy, low effort, <b>and</b> tastes arguably better than it did the day before!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you have a canvas, a frame, mineral spirits, linseed oil, and oil paint.</li>

            <li>In a container, mix your linseed oil with a small amount of mineral spirits.</li>
            <li>You should then prep your canvas by painting </li>
            <li>You can now start your underpainting by dipping your brush in the paint and then the mixture before adding it to your canvas.</li>
        </ol>
