        <h3>Day-old Pizza</h3>
        <p>I have lots of foods that I love, and my favorite food changes <b>excedingly</b> often, 
            but one that is always a good option is day-old pizza. I find cold pizza the day after 
            to be such a good comfort food. It's easy, low effort, <b>and</b> tastes arguably better than 
            it did the day before!</p>
